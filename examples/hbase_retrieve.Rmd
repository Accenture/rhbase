####This Document Describes and example of Pulling Data from HBase, doing some calculations on it, and storing the results

Ok, so now that our data is in HBase, lets create a plan for:
1. Retrieving Data with rhbase
2. Manipulating Data using Tidyr
3. Performing Calculations with timeseriesr
4. Storing Our Results using rhbase

Note: This example will be using the rhbase version provided by Aaron Benz, originally forked from Revo R's repo on github. For more information check out github.com/aaronbenz

```{r}
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
```
